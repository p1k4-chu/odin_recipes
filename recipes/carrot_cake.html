    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This is the best carrot cake recipe I have ever made! It's so moist and flavorful and makes a large quantity of cake. Since I started making it, I have been hounded to make this cake time and time again. Frost with cream cheese frosting.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 cups grated carrots</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup raisins</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup crushed pineapple, drained</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Combine grated carrots and brown sugar in a medium bowl. Let sit for 1 hour, then stir in raisins.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 10-inch round cake pans. Beat eggs in a large bowl until lighter in color.</li>
        <li>Gradually beat in white sugar, oil, and vanilla. Stir in pineapple.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl, then stir into egg mixture until absorbed.</li>
        <li>Stir in carrot mixture and walnuts. Pour evenly into the prepared cake pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool for 10 minutes before removing cake from the pans; let cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
